# Mushroom-Classification-problem


in the first file the nulls filled with unkonwn to maintain the data and because some mushroom too old or too damged some of its prperties can't be recongnized 

the second file the same model and everything but null imputated with knn imputation and would be seen the diffrent 

the third file will be the unkwon filled but with only SVM model
